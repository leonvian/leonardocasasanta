          **Pliability - Top Marketing Fit App**

          I handled all Android development tasks, including rebuilding most of the UI following design and product team guidelines. I fixed and enhanced issues identified via Crashlytics and analytics, revamped payment screens, implemented the app's most popular features from scratch, and upgraded the Player library to the latest version.

          Technologies: Android ExoPlayer, coroutines, Room (SQLite), Retrofit (REST), Android Navigation, Google Play Billing. images: ![Trees](/modern-resume-theme/images/pliability/screenshot1.png "") ![Trees](/modern-resume-theme/images/pliability/screenshot2.png "") ![Trees](/modern-resume-theme/images/pliability/screenshot3.png "")


          **Counslr - Therapy App**

          As the sole Android developer, I worked extensively on refactoring this legacy app, which had significant crashes and memory leaks. I introduced a repository layer using Retrofit and SQLite to reduce unnecessary API calls, rebranded the app, and redesigned 90% of its UI.

          Technologies: SendBird (chat framework), GraphQL, SQLite (Room).

          **3M Filtrete**

          This app connects to smart filters via Bluetooth to collect air quality data. I led a complete overhaul of the Bluetooth module, resolving numerous critical bugs and enhancing reliability. Additionally, I contributed to a UI redesign that dramatically improved the app's Google Play rating, elevating it from 1.6 to 4.5 during my tenure.

          Technologies: Bluetooth Low Energy integration, Accessibility Components.

          **Flavor Maker by McCormick**

          A content management app showcasing McCormickâ€™s products and recipes. I implemented multiple features, including the innovative "recipe battle" feature for influencers, push notification handling, and ensured accessibility compliance tailored for Canadian users.

          Technologies: Accessibility Components, Retrofit, modularization.

          **Quizlet**

          A large-scale project developed by a global multidisciplinary team. My responsibilities included maintaining the app, fixing a significant number of bugs, and delivering new features that positively impacted the app's yearly performance metrics.
